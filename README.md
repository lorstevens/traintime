# traintime

In this project I worked with Firebase Database and Moment.js for the first time. 
This page allows users to input the Train Name, Destination, first train time and the frequency in minutes. The application then calculates the next train arrival and how many minutes away it is. 
I used the Firebase Database to set the user input and prepend it to the page.
